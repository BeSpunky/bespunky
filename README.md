# Welcome! 🙋‍♂️ ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=bespunky)

My name is Shy, but I'm not that Shy. 😉
I'm a Full Stack Developer from Israel, but I've lived and worked in Chile for over 6 years.
To tell you the truth, I don't like calling myself a developer. I feel a lot more fortunate... I love what I do and do what I love.
My work is my art, which is why I see myself as a creator, a lover, an artist, a leader and only then - a developer.

Over the years I have gained a lot of experience and I've decided to give back to the community by launching a few open source projects.
Please feel free to shuffle through my repos. I love getting in touch with people, so don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, requests or feedback. 😊

Thank you for taking an interest and the time to review my art. 💕
